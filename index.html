<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>Marinate the Chicken:</p>

<p>a bowl, mix together yogurt, lemon juice, turmeric, garam masala, cumin, Kashmiri chili powder, ginger-garlic paste, and salt.
Add chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.</p>
<p>Grill the Chicken:</p>

<p>Preheat your grill, grill pan, or oven broiler.
Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers. Brush with vegetable oil.
Grill the chicken until it's charred and cooked through, turning occasionally. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Remove and set aside.</p>
<p>Prepare the Masala Sauce:</p>

<p>In a large pan, melt the butter or ghee over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute until fragrant.
Stir in the tomato puree, chili powder, garam masala, coriander, and turmeric. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the grilled chicken pieces to the sauce, mix well, and cook for another 5-10 minutes.
Lower the heat, add the cream or coconut milk, and stir well. Season with salt and sugar (if using). Simmer for another 5 minutes until the sauce thickens.
<p>Garnish and Serve:</p>
Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro.
<p>Serve hot with basmati rice or roti.
Enjoy your homemade Chicken Tikka Masala! Adjust the level of spices and cream to your preference.</p>
